    "# I. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we examined how people made dating decisions based on various attributes of their dates and the differences between women and men in considering various attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Context and Significance:\n",
    "Mate selection is a complex phenomenon influenced by various factors, where dating is the learning period for selecting potential marriage partners. 2023 data from the Pew Research Center finds that three in 10 Americans are single, and about half (51%) are open to either a committed relationship or casual dates. 56% of men are looking for either a committed relationship or casual dates, and 44% of women say the same thing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given the important status of dating in current American life and the potential differences among genders, this research will focus on analyzing data from a Speed Dating Experiment. The experiment involved participants engaging in speed dating sessions, where individuals (called daters) had brief interactions with other participants (called datees) and decided whether they wanted to date the datee again. During the events, daters were also asked to rate the datees in terms of various attributes, such as intelligence and attractiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Research Questions:\n",
    "Given the experiment settings, our research questions are: **(1)** How accurately can we predict people's decisions about whether they would like to meet their datees again based on their ratings on various attributes of the datees (how attractive, sincere, fun, ambitious, intelligent they think the datees are and how probable they think the datees would say yes to them)? **(2)** Are some predictors less or more important for the female or male participants? \n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary of Findings:\n",
    "We found that we could predict people's dating decisions with high accuracies (constantly around 75%). We also found that both female and male participants prefer more physically attractive and funnier datees. Male participants care even more about their datee's attractiveness than female participants. Moreover, when participants believe their datee is very likely to say yes to them, they would be more likely to say yes than say no to the datee."

    "### 2. Why was this dataset created?\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset was created to investigate and analyze various aspects of human dating behaviors in the context of speed dating. Researchers were interested in understanding how individuals make dating decisions, what attributes they consider important, and how different factors predict their decisions about whether to continue the relationship. The researchers were particularly interested in the gender differences in dating behaviors and decision-making strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Who funded the creation of the dataset?\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset was collected as part of academic research. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. What processes might have influenced what data was observed and recorded and what was not?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Participant Demographics: The age, gender, and demographic characteristics of the participants could influence whether they would be included in the sample. In this study, all subjects were from the graduate and professional schools of Columbia University, which might cause bias in what the researcher observed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Self-Selection of Participants: Participants in the speed dating experiment were volunteers, which means they self-selected to take part. This self-selection process may have introduced biases, as those who chose to participate might have different preferences or characteristics compared to the general population. This could impact the generalizability of the findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Experiment Design: The design of the speed dating experiment determined what data could be collected. The researchers structured the experiment, including the number of participants, the number of potential partners, and the available information about each partner. The experimental conditions may not fully represent real-world dating situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Survey Responses: The data collected was based on surveys filled out by participants. Data collection relied on participants' willingness to respond honestly and accurately, which could be influenced by social desirability bias or other factors. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. What preprocessing was done, and how did the data come to be in the form that you are using?\n",
    "\n",
    "There were 100+ variables in the original dataset, so we first carefully read through the 15-page variable codebook created by the researchers to filter out potential predictors and other necessary variables for our study based on domain expertise. We then renamed some of the columns to more meaningful names and changed the datatypes of some columns to the most appropriate types. We also removed biased observations, detected and removed inaccurate observations, and dealt with missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. If people are involved, were they aware of the data collection, and if so, what purpose did they expect the data to be used for?\n",
    "\n",
    "Participants in the speed dating events were aware of the data collection process, as informed consent was practiced by the researchers. They were also informed about the purpose of the data collection. Participants would have expected the data to be used to study dating behavior and potentially contribute to the understanding of human interactions and preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Where can your raw source data be found, if applicable? Provide a link to the raw data\n",

    "**Hypothesis 1**\n",
    "- **Hypothesis:** Generally, daters seriously consider various attributes in the datee (attractiveness, sincerity, fun, intelligence, ambition) when deciding whether they would like to meet the datee again. Also, how probable they feel the datee would say yes to them is a significant determinant in dating decisions.\n",
    "- **Reasoning:** Fun fact: Flavia is the Head of Analytics at Cornell Perfect Match. According to the Perfect Match survey results, people care about whether their dates are attractive, sincere, funny, intelligent, and ambitious (these are the top adjectives used to describe their ideal partner). Also, based on our intuition and experience, mutual liking is very important when people make dating decisions. Whether they think their dates like them can influence their decisions, so the variable prob might be a strong predictor.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis 2**\n",
    "- **Hypothesis:** Men might care more or less about the above attributes/factors than women. That is, gender differences exist in how people make dating decisions based on various attributes of the datees.\n",
    "- **Reasoning:** According to the Perfect Match survey results and our experience, women and men are quite different when evaluating their dates. So gender differences might be statistically significant.\n",

    "Overall, participants seldom gave low scores such as 1s or 2s when asked to rate their datees' several attributes. Interestingly, on average, male participants rated their female datees' attractiveness much higher than female participants rated male datees. Female participants rated their male datees' intelligence and ambition much higher than male participants rated female datees. \n",
    "\n",
    "Participants were also asked to rate how likely they felt their datee would be to say yes to them (1=not probable, 10=extremely probable). As shown in the sixth figure, the distribution is quite normal, meaning that most participants made a safe choice to avoid being overconfident or underconfident. However, it is hard to summarize the gender differences.\n",

    "Findings from these graphs encouraged us to include the interaction terms in our model so that we could examine the gender differences. And, as participants did give varying ratings for the attributes, they might be considering the attributes seriously when making dating decisions.\n",

Then, the first two observations are dependent because the ratings (our explanatory variables) and the decision (our response variable) are given by the same person.

The analysis was grounded in a comprehensive dataset collected during speed dating experiments conducted from 2002 to 2004, providing a unique glimpse into individual decision dynamics.\n",

    "Our analysis found that both female and male participants prefer more physically attractive and funnier dates. Male participants care even more about the attractiveness of their dates than female participants. Male participants prefer less sincere dates. Moreover, when participants think their date is more likely to say yes to them, they would be more likely to say yes than say no to the date.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best model for predicting people's dating decisions has five predictors, mainly including people's ratings for how attractive and funny the date is. The model yielded a cross-validation test accuracy of 74.8% and performed well.\n",

    "Our study aims to illuminate the intricacies of people's dating behaviors, with a specific focus on uncovering potential gender differences. Through comprehensive analysis and exploration, we seek to contribute valuable insights into the dynamics of romantic interactions, fostering a deeper understanding of how individuals navigate the dating landscape and the factors that may influence their behaviors based on gender. This research has the potential to enhance our knowledge of social dynamics, contributing to broader discussions on relationships and paving the way for more informed perspectives on gender-related aspects of dating."

    "1. The dataset is relatively old as the speed dating experiment was conducted from 2002 to 2004. However, we value this data because the experimental design allows us to observe individual decisions directly rather than just final matches. We tried looking for new data, but most of them came from dating apps, where many variants that might affect dating decisions were less observable and hard to measure. Using this speed-dating dataset allows us to predict people's dating outcomes with more meaningful variants. But we do acknowledge people's dating behaviors have changed over time, and our model might be less generalizable to the newest generations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. As previously mentioned, all participants in this study were drawn from the graduate and professional schools of Columbia University. The mean age of participants was 26.2, with an age range from 18 to 42. Consequently, our regression model may have limited generalizability to populations beyond this age range.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In the experimental setup, researchers assumed that all participants were interested in dating individuals of the opposite sex and paired them accordingly. However, it's important to acknowledge the possibility that some participants may identify with the LGBTQ+ group. This assumption about pairing may not accurately represent the diversity of dating preferences, and it could render some data invalid."
