    "# Part 1 - Introduction\n",
    "## Background Information:\n",
    "In this project, we look for different attributes' influence on dating decision and the differences among gender.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mate selection is a complex phenomenon influenced by various factors, where dating is the learning period for selecting potential marriage partners. 2023 data from Pew Research Center finds that three in 10 Americans are single, and about half (51%) are open to either a committed relationship or casual dates. Over half of men (56%) are looking for either a committed relationship or casual dates, and less than half of women (44%) say the same thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the important status of dating in current American's life, this research will focuses on analysis on a Speed Dating Experiement. The experiment involved participants engaging in speed dating sessions, where individuals had brief interactions and decided whether they wanted to date a potential match. The research highlights significant gender differences in decision-making during these speed dating sessions. For instance, the data shows that women are more likely to say \"Yes\" in their first meeting compared to men.\n",
    "## Research Questions:\n",
    "How accurately can we predict people's decision during the initial meet about whether they would like to meet their dates again based on their ratings on various attributes of their dates (attractiveness, sincerity, fun, intelligence, and ambition) Are some predictors less or more important for the female or male participants? \n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary of Findings:\n",
    "We found that people are more likely to say yes to dates who are more fun and attractive."

    "Self-Selection of Participants: Participants in the speed dating experiment were volunteers, which means they self-selected to take part. This self-selection process may have introduced biases, as those who chose to participate might have different preferences or characteristics compared to the general population. This could impact the generalizability of the findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Experiment Design: The design of the speed dating experiment determined what data could be collected. The researchers structured the experiment, including the number of participants, the number of potential partners, and the available information about each partner. The experimental conditions may not fully represent real-world dating situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Survey Responses: The data collected was based on surveys and questionnaires filled out by participants. Data collection relied on participants' willingness to respond honestly and accurately, which could be influenced by social desirability bias or other factors. \n",

    "## 5. What preprocessing was done, and how did the data come to be in the form that you are using?\n",
    "\n",
    "We selected columns necessary for our study. We then renamed some of the columns to more meaningful names, changed the datatypes of some columns to the most appropriate types, and removed missing data. \n",

    "\n",
    "Participants in the speed dating events would have been aware of the data collection process, as informed consent is a standard practice in research involving human subjects. They would have been informed about the purpose of the data collection, which is typically for academic research. Participants would have expected the data to be used to study dating behavior and potentially contribute to our understanding of human interactions and preferences.\n",

It turned out subjects aged below 20 or above 35, Black/African American, Latino/Hispanic American, and international students, and majors like Fine Arts/Arts Administration were underrepresented in the sample. One should be really careful about generalizing the resulting fitted model to these populations."

    "\n",
    "\"Logistic regression assumes that the observations in the dataset are independent of each other. That is, the observations should not come from repeated measurements of the same individual or be related to each other in any way.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "One common way to check this assumption is to make a plot of residual vs the order of observations and investigate any non-random patterns. At this step we have not fitted the model, so we cannot make the plot yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we know for sure the observations are NOT independent because of how the data was created. For example, say the first row represents the date between participant 1 and participant 2 and the second row represents the date between participant 1 and participant 3. Then the first two observations are dependent because the ratings, which are our explanatory variables, and the decision (our response variable) are given by the same person. They can take different values, but it is quite intuitive the same participant's ratings and decision towards different dates are dependent because of their unique rating/decision system and other personal bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that some participants dated more people than others in the experiment. To ensure participants making more decisions are not over-weighted in the model (and therefore address the abovementioned problem), the original paper weighted each observation by the inverse of num_dates (number of people the participant met in the event)."

Only attributes rate_p_attr and rate_p_fun are statistically significant which indicates daters consider various attributes in the date attractiveness and fun when deciding whether they would like to meet the datee again.

For hypothesis 2, our data did not support that women might care more or less about the above attributes than men and the existence of gender difference. "

    "1. The dataset is relatively old as the speed dating experiment was conducted from 2002 to 2004. However, we really appreciate this data because the experimental design allows us to directly observe individual decisions rather than just final matches. We tried looking for new data, but most of them came from dating apps, where many variants that might affect dating decisions were less observable and hard to measure. Using this speed dating dataset allows us to predict people's dating outcomes with far more variants. But we do acknowledge people's dating behaviors have changed over time, and our model might be less generalizable to the newest generations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. As previously mentioned, all participants in this study were drawn from the graduate and professional schools of Columbia University. The mean age of participants was 26.2, with an age range from 18 to 42. Consequently, our regression model may have limited generalizability to populations beyond this age range.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In the experimental setup, researchers assumed that all participants were interested in dating individuals of the opposite sex and paired them accordingly. However, it's important to acknowledge the possibility that some participants may identify with the LGBTQ+ group. This assumption about pairing may not accurately represent the diversity of dating preferences, and it could render some data invalid."
